                    <h2 class="title">Bali</h2>
                    <p>Bali is the most popular island holiday destination in the Indonesian archipelago. It’s home to an ancient culture that's known for its warm hospitality as well as exotic temples and palaces set against stunning natural backdrops. Dining in Bali presents endless choices of exotic, local cuisine. After sunset, famous nightspots come to life offering exciting clubbing and packed dance floors.</p>
                    <p>Inland, towering volcanoes and pristine jungles offer plenty to see and do, but you won't want to stay away from the coastline for long. Popular beach resorts include Kuta, Seminyak and Jimbaran where many of the finest hotels and villas look over world-class surf spots. For tranquil seascapes and sunrises, Sanur, Nusa Dua and remote Candidasa are your best bets. Bali’s lesser travelled eastern and northern regions also offer wonderful diving spots in calm bays, with coral gardens teeming with colourful marine biodiversity.</p>

                    <h2 class="title">Bromo</h2>
                    <p>Located some 4 hours drive from Surabaya, the capital of East Java, Mount Bromo is a part of the Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park that covers a massive area of 800 square km. While it may be small when measured against other volcanoes in Indonesia, the magnificent Mt Bromo will not disappoint with its spectacular views and dramatic landscapes. At 2,392 meters tall, Mt Bromo is not among the tallest of Indonesia’s mountains but its stunning beauty lies in its incredible setting.</p>
                    <p>The eerie landscape has spurned countless legends and myths. Mt Bromo has particular significance for the Tengger people who believe that this was the site where a brave prince sacrificed his life for his family. The people here appease the Gods once a year during the annual Kasada festival where offerings of vegetables, chickens and money are thrown into the crater of the volcano.</p>

                    <p>Located some 40 kilometers northwest of the city of Yogyakarta and about 75 kilometers south of Semarang, the capital city of Central Java Province, is the Magelang Regency, which is best known as the launching pad for a visit to the magnificent Borobudur Temple.
