                            <p>Cafe Lava Hostel is not a bad option considering the limited decent choices, but if you desire a Gunung Bromo view or better rooms, you’ll need to raise your budget. Their sister hotel, Lava View Lodge enjoys views over the crater from some rooms.</p>

Deluxe and Superior rooms offer a size advantage with Superior equipped with two king sized beds, but the old carpet and stained bathrooms had far less appeal and for around the same rate the newer deluxe rooms at Lava View Lodge are a better deal and offer a superior view.</p>

                            <p>With sweeping jungle views and simple but modern and stylish rooms, Pagupon Bromo is billed as “backpacker” digs, but it falls well into our midrange price bracket with particularly the shared bathroom rooms being of very debatable value, but when compared to the slim pickings further up the hill, well, it is a hard call—guests we spoke to loved it.</p>

                            <p>Bromo is a top-rated spot not only for foreign but also for locals. It’s a great bonding place for friends and family. Traffic jam all the way up, 4WD Jeeps parked in the mountain road. Tourists have to continue their adventure through walking up to the steep road of the mountain or rent for another motorcycle ride if comfort and convenience are your top priority.</p>
                            <p>You will gasp for more air as you continue your way up to the sunrise viewpoint, but you will surely be fine as you reach the destination. This experience is one of the best things to do in Bromo, Indonesia. A bit tiring but worth the trip!</p>

                            <h1>Horse Ride</h1>
                            <p>After all the walking and shivering, we are now moving to a more surreal adventure, horse riding in the desert of Bromo Tengger Semeru National Park. Our 4WD jeepneys drove us to our next stop. On arrival, a string of horses welcomed us. I was assisted by a man named Pikot and gave me a ride on his brownish black handsome horse, Jalun. Together, we traveled the vast sea of sand of Tengger, local name Laut Pasir. It’s a very dusty ride so make sure to get your mask on. Going up to the crater, horse ride is only optional since you can also reach it by foot. But the whole experience of taking the steep volcanic sandy path going up to the crater and riding at the back of a mighty horse,  splendid moment! That is why horse ride in the desert of Tengger is one of the best things to do in Bromo, Indonesia.</p>
