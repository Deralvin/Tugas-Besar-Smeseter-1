                            <p>The Borobudur temple is the biggest temple in the world for Buddhists. Constructed in three tiers in 750 AD, it holds 72 stupas each carrying a statue of Buddha around its massive ground of 2500 sq/m (0.6 acres) covered by walls and balustrades. No wonder the temple is listed as one of the UNESCO Heritage Sites. Book this guided tour for an in-depth experience, never missing important elements of the temple. Learn about the Vesak festivities, the significance of square-shaped structure with four entry point and a circular centre point, galleries of carved stone reliefs, the 328 Buddhas, the relevance of the 160 reliefs depicting scenes of Karmawibhangga Sutra, and a lot more.</p>

                            <p>Another experience that you should not miss out on while you are in the region, is watching the sunset. With the many temples and volcanoes that the region is home to, you will surely see a breathtaking sunset, with beautiful backgrounds. Just a one hour drive away from Yogjakarta you can find one of the most beautiful Hindu temples of Indonesia - the Prambanan Temple, also called Rara Jonggrang Temple. The templeâ€™s tall architecture - the central building is 47 meters (154 feet) tall - is impressive, and the temple also features many interesting sculptured walls.

                            <h1>Explore the Mendut Temple</h1>
                            <p>Located 3.5 km (2.1 miles) east of Borobudur, Mendut Temple is a small, but exquisite temple. It features a 3 meter high (9.8 feet) statue of Buddha, flanked by bodhisattvas: Lokesvara and Vairapana. Unlike other statues, the Buddha is displayed Western style - he is sitting with both feet on the ground. Especially at night, these statues are impressive as they are lit up against the dark sky. Visitors are usually allowed to enter after dark, if they are accompanied by a local guide. Next to the Mendut Temple, you can find a Buddhist monastery where you can join daily group meditations, or take part in meditation retreats that last a few days.</p>
